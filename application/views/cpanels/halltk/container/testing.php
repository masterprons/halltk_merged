            <p>
                Hello! I am Pranav Shinde. I am a Web Developer and a student forever. Learning is my passion and my hunger. 
                If there will nothing to learn in entire world, then I am damn sure that I will kill myself but fortunately learning never 
                ends even a calm, lonely and dark night can teach us lots of things. My efforts are the same; firstly I will learn things 
                and will try to present it on my website in easy and interesting manner.
            </p>

            </a>
            <p>
                At very first I am going to make available some things which are very essential for web developers and web designers just because
                I am working on such things. I am providing here some online tools websites which are most useful for web development. 
                And the another thing is the sets of content panels; yes, ready made content panels and some Javascript and Jquery plugins for 
                web designers to raise their efficiency.
                <br>
                You can learn by that ready made content also but for this case I am not willing to give here anymore like tutorial for web 
                designing because many things are already available on Internet; in fact I have learned almost all Web Development knowledge by 
                Internet and honestly telling I don't think myself eligible to teach anything to someone.
